I want to inform you that my name is Ritwick Roy roll number: 102016018, and I am a student in the CSE department. I want to state that I have currently been allotted hostel O. I would most humbly request you to change my hostel and shift me to hostel J as I am in my third year and want to focus more on my studies. To compete on a level basis with my peers, I need a supportive environment where I can function properly, allowing me to learn and practice classwork. I have a good CGPA of 9.8 and want to improve that. Also, the internship season will start, and I want to give full time to grab a good internship. To do the above, I need to have a room by myself, hence the hostel J as it's the only one with single seater rooms as of now. I would be grateful if you would entertain my request. I shall be highly obliged for your kind support.
